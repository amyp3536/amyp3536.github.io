            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>For this project, we started using the HTML & CSS skills we've been learning in class and applied it to create a webpage. Our assignment was to create our own movie webpage, and we are allowed to choose any idea we wanted with our partner. In this project, we had to meet the requirments and practice everything we learned so far onto the project.</p>
            <a href="https://app.pickcode.io/share/cmhoy7gj87n4a11jy7c2uvl41">Project Preview</a><br>
            <h3>Content</h3>
            <p>For this procject,we had to build a movie webpage with our HTML & CSS skills we've learned so far. We were given a set of requirments for both parts. For HTML, we needed to include things like, headings,paragraphs,divs,spans,Google fonts,images, and an input with a submit button. For CSS, we had to include things such as,selectors (elements,class,and id), and the box model including padding,margins, and borders. We also had to add images that were are own or Creative Commons. With building our Webpage, we had to make a plan using Markdown which we learned earlier. The plan showed how we were going to split the work.</p>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>One of the challenges we faced were actually deciding on an idea. My Partner and I kept going back and fourth becauses we didnt know what the movie should be about, and it took us awhile to agree on something we both liked. Once we figured it out, I struggled with getting the code to work the way I wanted. I had some trouble with HTML & CSS deatils, like wrting divs and spans correctly, fixing parts of my CSS that didnt work because of a missing bracket. I also didnt realize that checkboxes let you pick more tahn one button so I had to switch it to radio buttons. I overcame these challenges by looking over the FreeCodeCamp challnges that really helped me overcome these challnges and was a very helpful resource. A lot of these issues were small mistakes, but caused bigger problems. Overall, the hardest part was finding those small errors and making sure everything matched the requirments.</p>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>This project helped me understand how important it is to pay attention to small details in a code, this taught me to slow down and check my work carefully. Another takeaway was realizing the importance of planning. Even though choosing and idea was hard at first, and having a theme, the rest of the project became easier to organize. Another major takeaway was collaboration, and the importance of commmunicating. In this whole proccess of creating to finishing, it was important to hear eachothers opinions, input, and to work on it equally. Overall, this project made me realize how much Ive learned in HTML & CSS and also what I still need to practice.</p>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>I plan to take the feedback we get from this project, and build upon that. I also plan to continue working on my HTML & CSS skills in order to get more conftorable.</p>
